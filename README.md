Regular Expressions (now you’ve got two problems)
=================================================

Be afraid. Be very afraid. For you are about to enter the mysterious and foreboding land of regular expressions. A land of strange-looking hieroglyphics. A land of many flavors and implementations. A land whose inhabitants possess seemingly magical powers over text. But fear no more, for you needn't make the journey alone: a guide and a map await you.

In this session, we'll take a whirlwind tour of the features found in most regular expression implementations. Then we'll dive deep. We'll take a peek inside a regular expression engine. From character literals to character classes, from backreferences to look-around, you'll see every step a regular expression engine takes when it parses text. By the end of the session, you'll be able to think like a regular expression engine.

Stupid XML Serialization Tricks
===============================

Ok, maybe not stupid tricks. "Various techniques you can use to craft xml in the exact shape you need" is more accurate, but far less catchy. Although XML is less sexy as it was 10 years ago, it is still incredibly useful, and many enterprise codebases use it extensively. If you're a member of one of these organizations, knowing how to create an object graph that correctly serializes to the required XML is invaluable. This session will expose you to techniques that will help you get the job done. Be a hero. Save the day. All with XML serialization.

Bio
===

Brian Friesen has been pretending to be a developer for the last 6 years and lives in constant fear of being found out. As an occasional public speaker, he prefers to talk about things that are slightly out in left field. This explains why some people know him as "the regex guy" or "the monad guy". Seriously, who would choose those labels? Anyway, when he's not writing code, he's probably thinking about it, or, if he's sleeping, dreaming about it. In the rare case that no part of his mind is occupied by something vaguely code-related, he is probably playing with his kids or spending quality time with his wife near Detroit, where he has lived since 2012, when he took a job with the best company he has ever worked for, Quicken Loans. He is also a raging smart-alec.
